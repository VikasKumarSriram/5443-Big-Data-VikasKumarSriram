##TACTICAL BIG DATA ANALYTICS: CHALLENGES, USE CASES, AND SOLUTIONS

“Big Data” can be defined as data heaping up day by day at a phenomenal rate, admiring the working nature of sensors. While there is a considerable measure of data accessible, tools to analyze (or) investigate the so called big data (or) enormous information are largely missing. The article “Tactical Big Data Analytics: Challenges, Use Cases, and Solutions”, considers “Department of Defense(DOD)”, as an example to explain the urge for big data tools and solutions. The paper discusses the big data problems in DOD, such as bandwidth when considered the “The Naval Tactical Cloud” particularly in zones like shores, talks about security issues, for example corruption attacks, furthermoretells about the warfighters (queries compared to the data available) in tactical situations, while contrastingall these to today’s big data issues, thereby analyzing the problems in the DOD, portrayingtwo test cases namely “Big Data analytics with multi-intelligence (multi-INT)sensor data”, where the analysis will be carried out on data available at multiple locations and “man-machine crowdsourcing using MapReduce framework”, where large amounts of data present online are analyzed through human and system effort. Furthermore,the problemsarised in these test cases are evaluated using Cloud computing and Big Data analytics and the solutions of the problems are notified in the present paper(Savas, Sagduyu, Deng, & Li, 2014).
