##Modeling and Analytics for Cyber-Physical Systems in the Age of Big Data

In this paper the author discussed about the impact of data collected from Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS) using ubiquitous sensing with respect to CPS modeling and analytics. They discussed new challenges for CPS modeling like partial knowledge of input-output relocations and online processing of high dimensional, low-quality data. They also discussed opportunities related to CPS management like modeling switched systems and new applications coming from big data. Major differences between CPS and IT systems are addressed which further lead to call for the further research on combining CPS modeling with analytics. They are as follows:

•	The Tight interaction of computing elements with physical world through feedback control loops.
•	A rigorous engineering process for mission critical CPS.
•	CPS systems exhibit more operating modes compared to IT systems.
•	Role and interpretation of analytics.

It is also mentioned some research directions to deal with the challenges and opportunities they mentioned earlier.
