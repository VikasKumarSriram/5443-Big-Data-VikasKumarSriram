## Stat! â€“ An Interactive Analytics Environment for Big Data

In this paper, the authors have discussed about an interactive analytics environment called Stat! It helps data scientists to incrementally and rapidly query and obtain partial results in both textual and visual format. In the demonstration stated in the paper, they have used Stat! with the Microsoft StreamInsight that is used to refine queries efficiently and to generate early results as the size of the data to be processed increases. 
This interactive environment facilitates dynamic composition of multiple queries to obtain partial results over big data. Interactive analytics takes two forms: full-data processing and progressive processing. The former allows queries over the entire data only. The latter allows queries over partially processed data. In such cases, partial results are generated which are then combined to get the final result once the entire data is processed.
