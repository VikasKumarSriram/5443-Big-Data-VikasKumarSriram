## CloST: A Hadoop-based Storage System for Big Spatio-Temporal Data Analytics

In this paper the authors discussed how the ‘big spatio-temporal data’ which means the huge amount of data generated from GPS-equipped devices analytics is done using Hadoop by implementing CloST, a scable storage system. They discussed how this CloST is designed and implemented. CloST will not access the whole data set for analytics instead will work on some peculiar and core attributes such as object id, location, time etc. This tool hierarchically partitions data based on the above attributes. They proposed the data loading algorithms which add the data incrementally to the system. They conducted experiments on huge data sets of GPS data and concluded that results from CloST has the fast data loading speed, reasonable scalability in query processing and higncomparision ratio too.
